# Tektites

This repository is for developing the bayesian MCMC model for predicting tektite endmembers and compositions. 

The code contains three parts. 

(1) Read in, reduce, and renormalize the data using Bayesian_MT_Analysis_Input_Data.py

(2) All methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Bayesian_MT_Methods.py)

(3) Bayesian_MT_MCMC.ipynb run, analyse, plot, and store results of MCMC.
